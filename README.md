# MEDIA INSIGHTS ENGINE APPLICATION

The Media Insights Engine (MIE) web application provides a user interface for configuring MIE workflows, running workflows, and analyzing the metadata generated by said workflows. This application is architected with the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) JavaScript framework. 

# DEPLOY

#### If you have an existing MIE deployment in your account, use this template:

Region| Launch
------|-----
US East (N. Virginia) | [![Launch in us-east-1](doc/images/launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=mie&templateURL=https://rodeolabz-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/content-analysis-solution/beta01/cf/aws-content-analysis.template)
US West (Oregon) | [![Launch in us-west-2](doc/images/launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=mie&templateURL=https://rodeolabz-us-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/content-analysis-solution/beta01/cf/aws-content-analysis.template)



#### If you would like a MIE instance to be deployed with the web application, use this template:

Region| Launch

# USER'S GUIDE:

1. Upload videos in the upload button. Once the upload completes, it will automatically be processed with the MieComplete Workflow (i.e. the Kitchen sink) which includes every media analysis operator in MIE.
2. The workflow status will be shown in the Collection view. Status will be updated when you reload the page.
3. The search field in the Collection view searches the full metadata database in Elasticsearch. Everything you see in the analysis page is searchable. Even data that is excluded by the threshold you set in the Confidence slider is searchable. Search queries must use valid Lucene syntax.

Here are some sample searches:

* Since Content Moderation returns a "Violence" label when it detects violence in a video, you can search for any video containing violence simply with: `Violence`
* Search for videos containing violence with a 80% confidence threshold: `Violence AND Confidence:>80` 
* The previous queries may match videos whose transcript contains the word "Violence". You can restrict your search to only Content Moderation results, like this: `Operator:content_moderation AND (Name:Violence AND Confidence:>80)`
* To search for Violence results in Content Moderation and guns or weapons identified by Label Detection, try this: `(Operator:content_moderation AND Name:Violence AND Confidence:>80) OR (Operator:label_detection AND (Name:Gun OR Name:Weapon))`  
* You can search for phrases in Comprehend results like this, `PhraseText:"some deep water" AND Confidence:>80`
* To see the full set of attributes that you can search for, click the Analytics menu item and search for "*" in the Discover tab of Kibana.
